# SSR Production Readiness

This directory contains the complete plan for taking Composable Svelte's SSR implementation from functional to production-ready.

## Documents

### 📋 [PRODUCTION-READINESS-PLAN.md](./PRODUCTION-READINESS-PLAN.md)
**Complete implementation plan with code examples**

Comprehensive plan covering:
- Phase 1: Security Hardening (P0 - Critical)
- Phase 2: Error Handling & Resilience (P0 - Critical)
- Phase 3: Performance Optimization (P1 - High)
- Phase 4: Testing & Quality (P1 - High)
- Phase 5: Documentation & DX (P2 - Medium)
- Phase 6: Deployment & DevOps (P2 - Medium)

Includes detailed code examples, TypeScript interfaces, and integration guides for each phase.

### ✅ [CHECKLIST.md](./CHECKLIST.md)
**Quick reference checklist for tracking progress**

Task-by-task checklist with:
- All deliverables organized by phase
- Checkboxes for tracking completion
- Time estimates
- Success metrics
- Progress tracking section

## Current Status

**Framework Core**: ✅ Solid foundation - rendering, hydration, routing work correctly
**Example Implementation**: ⚠️ Functional but requires production hardening

### What Works Today

- ✅ Server-side rendering with Svelte 5
- ✅ Client-side hydration
- ✅ Isomorphic routing (URL parameters, nested routes)
- ✅ State serialization and hydration
- ✅ Meta tag management
- ✅ Basic E2E tests

### What Needs Work

- ❌ Security (XSS protection, rate limiting, headers)
- ❌ Error handling (404, 500, validation)
- ❌ Performance (caching, compression, optimization)
- ⚠️ Testing (outdated tests, missing coverage)
- ⚠️ Documentation (minimal)
- ❌ Deployment (no Docker, CI/CD)

## Quick Start

To begin implementation:

1. **Review the plan**: Read [PRODUCTION-READINESS-PLAN.md](./PRODUCTION-READINESS-PLAN.md)
2. **Start with Phase 1**: Security is critical - begin with security hardening
3. **Track progress**: Use [CHECKLIST.md](./CHECKLIST.md) to mark completed tasks
4. **Test thoroughly**: Each phase includes testing requirements

## Timeline

**Total Estimated Time**: 14-18 days

| Phase | Priority | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| Phase 1: Security | 🔴 Critical | 2-3 days | ⏳ Not Started |
| Phase 2: Error Handling | 🔴 Critical | 2 days | ⏳ Not Started |
| Phase 3: Performance | 🟡 High | 3-4 days | ⏳ Not Started |
| Phase 4: Testing | 🟡 High | 3-4 days | ⏳ Not Started |
| Phase 5: Documentation | 🟢 Medium | 2-3 days | ⏳ Not Started |
| Phase 6: Deployment | 🟢 Medium | 2 days | ⏳ Not Started |

## Key Principles

### 1. Framework-First Approach
Put as much as possible in the **framework** (`packages/core/src/lib/ssr/`) to make it reusable:
- Security middleware (headers, sanitization, rate limiting)
- Error handling utilities
- Caching utilities
- Validation framework
- Compression helpers

### 2. Example as Reference
The **example** (`examples/ssr-server/`) should demonstrate best practices:
- How to apply security middleware
- How to configure caching
- How to handle errors
- How to deploy to production

### 3. Test Everything
Every framework utility must have:
- Unit tests (90%+ coverage)
- Integration tests
- Documentation with examples

### 4. Security First
Security is not optional:
- XSS protection via HTML sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent DoS
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Input validation on all routes

### 5. Performance Matters
Target metrics:
- <200ms server response time (P95)
- >70% cache hit rate
- <100KB gzipped bundle size

## Success Criteria

Before declaring production-ready:

### Framework
- ✅ All security utilities implemented and tested
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage for SSR utilities
- ✅ Complete API documentation
- ✅ Zero security vulnerabilities

### Example
- ✅ All E2E tests passing
- ✅ Performance benchmarks meeting targets
- ✅ Docker deployment working
- ✅ Production-ready configuration

### Documentation
- ✅ Framework guide complete
- ✅ Security guide complete
- ✅ API reference complete
- ✅ Deployment guide complete

## Next Steps

1. **Start Phase 1**: Security hardening is critical
   - Implement security headers middleware
   - Implement HTML sanitization
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Apply to example and test

2. **Continue with Phase 2**: Error handling
   - Can be developed in parallel with Phase 1
   - Critical for production reliability

3. **Follow sequence for Phases 3-6**: Build on previous phases

## Questions?

- Review the detailed plan for implementation guidance
- Check the checklist for task-level details
- Each phase includes code examples and integration guides
