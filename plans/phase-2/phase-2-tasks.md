# Phase 2: Navigation System - Detailed Tasks

**Duration**: Week 3-4 (15-20 hours/week)
**Deliverable**: `@composable-svelte/core@0.2.0` with navigation system
**Spec Reference**: `navigation-spec.md`
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: âœ… READY TO START

---

## Overview

Phase 2 implements the navigation system that enables tree-based and stack-based navigation patterns. This phase provides the foundation for modal dialogs, sheets, drawers, navigation stacks, and other presentation styles - all managed through state.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Navigation types (PresentationAction, StackAction)
- Navigation operators (ifLet, createDestinationReducer, matchPresentationAction)
- Navigation components (Modal, Sheet, Drawer, NavigationStack, Alert)
- Dismiss dependency for child self-dismissal
- Stack navigation utilities
- Optional: SvelteKit integration (can be deferred to Phase 6)

**Important Note**: SvelteKit integration (section 2.5 in implementation plan) is **OPTIONAL** for this phase. It can be deferred to Phase 6 or implemented as a separate package. Focus on core navigation primitives first.

## Task 2.1: Navigation Types

### Task 2.1.1: Define PresentationAction Type
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Dependencies**: None
**File**: `packages/core/src/navigation/types.ts`

**Description**:
Create the PresentationAction discriminated union that wraps child actions to enable parent observation of child navigation events.

**What to do**:
- Define PresentationAction<T> as discriminated union with 'presented' and 'dismiss' variants
- 'presented' variant wraps the child action
- 'dismiss' variant has no payload (simple dismissal signal)
- Add comprehensive JSDoc with examples
- Export type from navigation module

**Spec Reference**: `navigation-spec.md` Section 3.2 - "PresentationAction Pattern"

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] PresentationAction<T> type defined correctly
- [ ] Type is a discriminated union with 'presented' and 'dismiss'
- [ ] JSDoc includes usage examples
- [ ] Type exported from navigation/types.ts
- [ ] TypeScript inference works without explicit type parameters

---

### Task 2.1.2: Define StackAction Type
**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes
**Dependencies**: None
**File**: `packages/core/src/navigation/types.ts`

**Description**:
Create the StackAction discriminated union for stack-based navigation (push, pop, popToRoot, setPath).

**What to do**:
- Define StackAction<A, S> with four variants: push, pop, popToRoot, setPath
- push: contains screen state to add to stack
- pop: no payload, removes top screen
- popToRoot: no payload, clears to root
- setPath: contains array of screen states for deep linking
- Add element action wrapper for dispatching actions at stack indices
- Include JSDoc with stack navigation examples

**Spec Reference**: `navigation-spec.md` Section 5 - "Stack-Based Navigation"

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] StackAction<A, S> type defined with all variants
- [ ] Element action variant included for dispatching at indices
- [ ] Types support generic screen state
- [ ] JSDoc documents all action types
- [ ] Examples show typical stack operations

---

### Task 2.1.3: Create Navigation Types Index

**Dependencies**: Tasks 2.1.1, 2.1.2
**File**: `packages/core/src/navigation/types.ts`

**Description**:
Export all navigation types from a single module with organized documentation.

**What to do**:

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All types exported from navigation/types.ts

## Task 2.2: Navigation Operators

### Task 2.2.1: Implement ifLet() Operator
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 2.1.1
**File**: `packages/core/src/navigation/operators.ts`

**Description**:
Implement the ifLet() operator for integrating optional child state into parent reducers. This is the core primitive for optional navigation (modals, sheets, etc.).

**What to do**:

- Handle PresentationAction.dismiss by setting child state to null
- Add comprehensive JSDoc with modal/sheet examples

**Important**:
- ifLet() is similar to scope() but adds null-handling logic
- When child state is null, any parent actions targeting it are ignored
- dismiss action always sets child state to null regardless of current state

**Spec Reference**: `navigation-spec.md` Section 3.3 - "ifLet() Operator"

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] ifLet() correctly handles null child state
- [ ] Returns [state, Effect.none()] when child is null

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] createDestinationReducer() accepts reducer map
- [ ] Correctly routes to child reducer based on destination type

## Summary

**Total Estimated Time**: 50-65 hours (3-4 weeks at 15-20 hours/week)

**Critical Path**:
1. Navigation types (2.1.x) â†’ Operators (2.2.x) â†’ Components (2.5.x)
2. Stack types (2.1.2) â†’ Stack helpers (2.3.x) â†’ NavigationStack (2.5.4)
3. Testing (2.6.x) can happen in parallel with component development
4. Examples (2.7.x) after core implementation
5. Documentation (2.8.x) at the end

**Deferred Items**:
- SvelteKit integration (optional, can be Phase 6)
- Advanced animations (Phase 4)
- DSL utilities (Phase 3)
- Focus management (Phase 5)

**Phase 2 Success Criteria**:
- Users can implement tree-based navigation with modals/sheets
- Stack-based navigation works for multi-screen flows
- Children can dismiss themselves via dependency
- All navigation is state-driven and testable
- Components provide good defaults with customization
- Examples demonstrate real-world usage

**Key Principles**:
- State drives navigation (non-null = show, null = hide)
- Parent features observe child navigation events
- Navigation is composable through reducers
- Components are presentation-only, logic in reducers
- Testing uses TestStore for deterministic navigation flows
