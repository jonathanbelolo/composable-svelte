# Phase 4: Animation Integration - Detailed Task Breakdown

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks (60-80 hours)
**Deliverable**: `@composable-svelte/core@0.4.0` with Motion One-based animations
**Spec Reference**: `specs/frontend/animation-integration-spec.md`
**Status**: In Progress
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-27

---

## Overview

Phase 4 integrates **Motion One**-based animations into the navigation system, providing **state-driven**, spring-physics animations for all presentation components. This phase enforces a single, consistent animation approach throughout the architecture.

**Key Design Decisions**:

1. **Motion One Only** (no Svelte transitions)
   - Ensures one consistent way to animate across the library
   - Forces proper `PresentationState` lifecycle usage
   - Provides natural spring physics by default
   - GPU-accelerated via Web Animations API (~11kb tree-shakeable)

2. **State-Driven Animations** (not DOM-lifecycle driven)
   - Animations triggered by `$effect` watching `presentation.status` changes
   - NOT triggered by Svelte's mount/unmount lifecycle (`use:` actions)
   - Enables coordination between sequential/parallel animations
   - Makes animations deterministic, testable, and debuggable

**Core Principle**: Animations are STATE, not side effects. Animation lifecycle is tracked in reducers via `PresentationState<T>`, making animations fully testable and time-travel debuggable.

**Why State-Driven?**: Enables coordination that DOM-lifecycle animations cannot provide:
```typescript
// Sequential: Dismiss Modal A → Wait 300ms → Present Sheet B
// Parallel: Fade out modal + backdrop simultaneously
// Conditional: Only present B if A dismissed successfully (not cancelled)
// Staggered: Present modal, wait 100ms, present tooltip
```

## Major Milestones

1. **M4.1**: Foundation (Types & Effects) ✅ COMPLETE
2. **M4.2**: Motion One Integration (Package + Utils) ✅ COMPLETE
3. **M4.3**: Component Updates (Modal, Sheet, Drawer, Alert) ✅ COMPLETE

## Section 1: Foundation (COMPLETE ✅)

### Task 4.1.1: Animation Types
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour ✅ DONE
**Dependencies**: None
**Files**: `packages/core/src/navigation/types.ts`

**Description**:
Define TypeScript types for animation lifecycle tracking. `PresentationState<T>` provides a discriminated union tracking the four-state animation lifecycle: idle → presenting → presented → dismissing → idle.

**What was done**:
- Added `PresentationState<T>` discriminated union type
- Added `PresentationEvent` type for lifecycle transitions
- Exported types from navigation and core modules
- Comprehensive JSDoc with lifecycle examples
- Documented dual-field pattern (destination + presentation)

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 2.1-2.2

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] `PresentationState<T>` has all four states (idle, presenting, presented, dismissing)
- [x] Optional `duration` field for presenting/dismissing states
- [x] `PresentationEvent` covers all lifecycle events
- [x] Types exported from core package
- [x] JSDoc explains why destination/presentation are separate fields

---

### Task 4.1.2: Effect Helpers
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours ✅ DONE
**Dependencies**: Task 4.1.1
**Files**: `packages/core/src/effect.ts`

**Description**:
Implement convenience Effect helpers for animation timing. `Effect.animated()` provides a clean API for duration-based state transitions, while `Effect.transition()` generates symmetric present/dismiss effect pairs.

**What was done**:
- Implemented `Effect.animated({ duration, onComplete })` helper
- Implemented `Effect.transition({ presentDuration?, dismissDuration?, createPresentationEvent })` helper
- Added validation for negative durations (throws TypeError)
- Comprehensive JSDoc with timeout fallback examples
- Defaults: 300ms present, 200ms dismiss

**Important**: These are library-agnostic - they work with ANY animation approach (Motion One, CSS, manual setTimeout, etc.). They just dispatch actions after durations.

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 4.2-4.3

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] `Effect.animated()` dispatches action after duration
- [x] `Effect.transition()` returns { present, dismiss } effect pair
- [x] Negative duration throws TypeError
- [x] Effects integrate with existing Effect.map() and Effect.batch()
- [x] JSDoc includes timeout fallback patterns

---

## Section 2: Motion One Integration

### Task 4.2.1: Install Motion One Dependency
**Estimated Time**: 0.5 hours ✅ DONE
**Dependencies**: None
**Files**: `packages/core/package.json`

**Description**:
Add Motion One as a required dependency (NOT peer dependency). This enforces the architectural decision to use Motion One everywhere for consistency.

**What was done**:
- Added `motion` v11.11.17 to dependencies
- Verified installation with `pnpm install`
- Successfully imported `{ animate }` from `motion` in animation utilities
- Tree-shaking confirmed working in build output

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] `motion` added to `dependencies` (not `devDependencies` or `peerDependencies`)
- [x] Package installs without errors
- [x] Can import `{ animate }` from `motion`
- [x] Verify tree-shaking in build output

---

### Task 4.2.2: Create Animation Utility Functions
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours ✅ COMPLETE
**Dependencies**: Task 4.2.1
**Files**: `packages/core/src/animation/animate.ts`

**Description**:
Create reusable animation utility functions that wrap Motion One with opinionated defaults for the Composable Svelte architecture. These are **pure functions** that accept an element and return a Promise, designed to be called from component `$effect` blocks.

**What was done**:
- Created `animateModalIn()` and `animateModalOut()` with scale + fade
- Created `animateBackdropIn()` and `animateBackdropOut()` with fade only
- Fixed Motion One API usage (inline spring config instead of `spring()` function)
- Added RAF wait after animations for style application
- Error handling: animations catch errors and always resolve
- Used inline spring configs: `{ type: 'spring', visualDuration, bounce }`

**What to do**:
- Create `animateModalIn(node, options?)` for modal presentation
- Create `animateModalOut(node, options?)` for modal dismissal
- Create `animateSheetIn(node, options?)` for sheet presentation (slide up/side)
- Create `animateSheetOut(node, options?)` for sheet dismissal
- Create `animateDrawerIn(node, options?)` for drawer presentation (slide left/right)
- Create `animateDrawerOut(node, options?)` for drawer dismissal
- Create `animateAlertIn(node, options?)` for alert presentation (subtle)
- Create `animateAlertOut(node, options?)` for alert dismissal
- Export default spring configurations for each component type
- Handle animation errors gracefully (catch, log, resolve Promise anyway)

**Default Spring Configurations**:
```typescript
export const springConfigs = {
  modal: { stiffness: 300, damping: 30 },    // Snappy
  sheet: { stiffness: 250, damping: 28 },    // Softer (larger movement)
  drawer: { stiffness: 280, damping: 25 },   // Smooth
  alert: { stiffness: 350, damping: 35 }     // Very snappy (subtle animation)
};
```

**Default Animations**:
- **Modal**: opacity (0→1) + scale (0.95→1)
- **Sheet**: opacity (0→1) + translateY (100%→0) or translateX (side sheets)
- **Drawer**: opacity (0→1) + translateX (-100%→0 or 100%→0)
- **Alert**: opacity (0→1) + scale (0.98→1) - subtle

**Error Handling Pattern**:
```typescript
export async function animateModalIn(
  node: HTMLElement,
  options?: Partial<SpringConfig>
): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await animate(
      node,
      { opacity: [0, 1], scale: [0.95, 1] },
      { easing: spring({ ...springConfigs.modal, ...options }) }
    ).finished;
  } catch (error) {
    // Log but don't throw - always resolve to prevent stuck states
    console.error('[animate] Modal animation failed:', error);
  }
}
```

**Important Design Decision**: Functions return `Promise<void>`, NOT the Animation object. This keeps the API simple and prevents misuse (users shouldn't cancel/pause manually - state controls everything).

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 5.1-5.2, section 6 (error handling)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Modal animation functions exported (in + out) + backdrop (in + out)
- [x] All functions return `Promise<void>`
- [x] Default spring configs used (visualDuration + bounce)
- [x] Animation errors caught and logged (don't throw)
- [x] Functions always resolve (even on error) to prevent stuck states
- [x] Sheet animation functions (slide from bottom/side)
- [x] Drawer animation functions (slide from left/right)
- [x] Alert animation functions (subtle scale + fade)

---

### Task 4.2.3: Create Spring Configuration Types
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour ✅ DONE
**Dependencies**: Task 4.2.2
**Files**: `packages/core/src/animation/types.ts`

**Description**:
Define TypeScript types and helper functions for spring configuration. Provide validated spring config objects that can be passed to animation functions or overridden by users.

**What was done**:
- Created `SpringConfig` interface with `visualDuration` and `bounce` fields
- Used Motion One's native spring config format (not custom parameters)
- Defined default configs: modal (0.3s, 0.25), backdrop (0.2s, 0)
- Exported from animation module
- Comprehensive JSDoc with usage examples

**What to do**:
- Define `SpringConfig` interface (stiffness, damping, duration?, mass?)
- Create `createSpringConfig()` helper with validation
- Export preset configs (modal, sheet, drawer, alert)
- Provide `mergeSpringConfig()` helper for user overrides
- Add JSDoc explaining spring physics parameters

**Spring Physics Parameters**:
```typescript
export interface SpringConfig {
  stiffness: number;  // Higher = snappier (100-500)
  damping: number;    // Higher = less bouncy (10-50)
  mass?: number;      // Weight of animated object (0.1-10, default 1)
  duration?: number;  // Max duration fallback (optional)
}
```

**Validation**:
- Stiffness must be > 0
- Damping must be > 0
- Mass must be > 0 (if provided)
- Duration must be >= 0 (if provided)

**Spec Reference**: Motion One documentation, animation-integration-spec.md section 5.2

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] `SpringConfig` interface defined with visualDuration and bounce
- [x] Default configs exported for modal and backdrop
- [x] JSDoc explains Motion One spring parameters
- [x] Additional component configs (sheet, drawer, alert)
- [ ] Validation helpers (deferred - not needed yet)

## Section 3: Component Updates

### Task 4.3.1: Update Modal Component with State-Driven Animations
**Estimated Time**: 5 hours ✅ DONE
**Dependencies**: Task 4.2.2, Task 4.2.3
**Files**: `packages/core/src/navigation-components/primitives/ModalPrimitive.svelte`, `packages/core/src/navigation-components/Modal.svelte`

**Description**:
Refactor Modal component to use Motion One animations driven by `PresentationState` lifecycle. Modal uses `$effect` to watch state changes and trigger animations, NOT Svelte's mount/unmount lifecycle.

**What was done**:
- Updated ModalPrimitive to accept `presentation` prop and animation callbacks
- Added `$effect` watching `presentation.status` to trigger animations
- Integrated `animateModalIn/Out` and `animateBackdropIn/Out` functions
- Used `lastAnimatedContent` tracking to prevent duplicate animations
- Fixed backdrop `pointer-events: none` to allow clicks through to content
- Callbacks fire when animation Promises resolve
- Element stays mounted during `dismissing` state for exit animation
- Fixed portal + focus trap + click-outside integration
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Backdrop now has `pointer-events: none` permanently so clicks pass through to content (clickOutside handler on content handles dismissal)

**What to do**:
- Accept `presentation: PresentationState<any>` prop (replaces simple `store` usage)
- Accept `onPresentationComplete?: () => void` callback prop
- Accept `onDismissalComplete?: () => void` callback prop
- Accept `springConfig?: Partial<SpringConfig>` prop for overrides
- Create `contentElement: HTMLElement` binding
- Create `backdropElement: HTMLElement` binding
- Add `$effect` that watches `presentation.status` and triggers animations:
  - When `presenting`: Call `animateModalIn(contentElement, springConfig)` + `animateBackdropIn(backdropElement)`
  - When `dismissing`: Call `animateModalOut(contentElement, springConfig)` + `animateBackdropOut(backdropElement)`
  - Call appropriate callback when Promise resolves
- Only render when `presentation.status !== 'idle'`
- Keep content mounted during `dismissing` for exit animation

**Component Structure**:
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { animateModalIn, animateModalOut, animateBackdropIn, animateBackdropOut } from './utils/animate';
  import type { PresentationState, SpringConfig } from '$lib/composable';

  interface Props {
    presentation: PresentationState<any>;
    onPresentationComplete?: () => void;
    onDismissalComplete?: () => void;
    springConfig?: Partial<SpringConfig>;
    disableClickOutside?: boolean;
    children: Snippet;
  }

  let {
    presentation,
    onPresentationComplete,
    onDismissalComplete,
    springConfig,
    disableClickOutside = false,
    children
  }: Props = $props();

  let contentElement: HTMLElement;
  let backdropElement: HTMLElement;

  // Watch presentation state and trigger animations
  $effect(() => {
    if (!contentElement || !backdropElement) return;

    if (presentation.status === 'presenting') {
      Promise.all([
        animateModalIn(contentElement, springConfig),
        animateBackdropIn(backdropElement)
      ]).then(() => {
        onPresentationComplete?.();
      });
    }

    if (presentation.status === 'dismissing') {
      Promise.all([
        animateModalOut(contentElement, springConfig),
        animateBackdropOut(backdropElement)
      ]).then(() => {
        onDismissalComplete?.();
      });
    }
  });

  function handleBackdropClick() {
    if (!disableClickOutside && presentation.status === 'presented') {
      onDismissalComplete?.();  // Let parent handle dismissal
    }
  }
</script>

{#if presentation.status !== 'idle'}
  <div
    bind:this={backdropElement}
    class="modal-backdrop"
    onclick={handleBackdropClick}
  >
    <div
      bind:this={contentElement}
      class="modal-content"
      onclick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
    >
      {@render children()}
    </div>
  </div>
{/if}
```

**Important Behavior**:
- Element renders when state becomes `presenting` (triggers animation)
- Element stays mounted through `presenting` → `presented` → `dismissing`
- Element unmounts when state becomes `idle` (after animation completes)
- Animations start via `$effect` watching status, NOT on mount
- Parent controls state transitions via presentation events

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 5.2-5.3

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Modal animates in with scale (0.95 → 1) + fade (0 → 1)
- [x] Modal animates out with reverse animation
- [x] Animations triggered by `$effect` watching `presentation.status`
- [x] Callbacks fire when animations complete
- [x] Backdrop animates independently (fade only)
- [x] Spring physics configured with visualDuration + bounce
- [x] Component stays mounted during `dismissing`
- [x] Content not mounted when `idle`
- [x] Backdrop doesn't intercept pointer events (critical fix!)

### Task 4.3.2: Update Sheet Component with State-Driven Animations
**Estimated Time**: 5 hours ✅ COMPLETE
**Dependencies**: Task 4.2.2, Task 4.2.3
**Files**: `packages/core/src/navigation-components/primitives/SheetPrimitive.svelte`, `packages/core/src/navigation-components/Sheet.svelte`

**Description**:
Refactor Sheet component to use Motion One animations driven by state. Sheet slides up from bottom (mobile) or from side (desktop) with spring physics.

**What to do**:
- Accept `presentation: PresentationState<any>` prop
- Accept `side?: 'bottom' | 'left' | 'right'` prop (default: 'bottom')
- Accept spring configuration override
- Add `$effect` watching `presentation.status`
- Animate translateY (bottom) or translateX (left/right) based on `side`
- Use softer spring than Modal (stiffness: 250, damping: 28)
- Call callbacks on animation completion
- Handle backdrop click to dismiss

**Animation Strategy**:
- **Bottom**: `translateY: [100%, 0]` (slide up)
- **Left**: `translateX: [-100%, 0]` (slide from left)
- **Right**: `translateX: [100%, 0]` (slide from right)
- All include opacity fade

**Important**: Sheet animations should feel slightly softer than Modal due to larger movement distance. This is more natural for larger UI elements.

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 5.2

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Sheet slides in from edge with spring physics
- [x] Sheet slides out to edge on dismiss
- [x] Softer spring than Modal (feels natural for large movement)
- [x] Animations triggered by `$effect` watching state
- [x] Callbacks fire correctly
- [x] Works on mobile (bottom) and desktop (side) layouts
- [x] Backdrop fades in/out independently

---

### Task 4.3.3: Update Drawer Component with State-Driven Animations
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours ✅ COMPLETE
**Dependencies**: Task 4.2.2, Task 4.2.3
**Files**: `packages/core/src/navigation-components/primitives/DrawerPrimitive.svelte`, `packages/core/src/navigation-components/Drawer.svelte`

**Description**:
Refactor Drawer component to use Motion One animations driven by state. Drawer slides from left or right with smooth spring physics.

**What to do**:
- Accept `presentation: PresentationState<any>` prop
- Accept `side?: 'left' | 'right'` prop (default: 'left')
- Accept spring configuration override
- Add `$effect` watching `presentation.status`
- Animate translateX based on `side` prop
- Use smooth spring (stiffness: 280, damping: 25)
- Call callbacks on animation completion
- Handle overlay backdrop animation

**Animation Strategy**:
- **Left**: `translateX: [-100%, 0]`
- **Right**: `translateX: [100%, 0]`
- Include opacity fade for backdrop

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 5.2

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Drawer slides in from left or right edge
- [x] Drawer slides out on dismiss
- [x] Smooth, polished spring animation
- [x] Animations triggered by `$effect` watching state
- [x] Callbacks fire correctly
- [x] Backdrop fades in/out independently

---

### Task 4.3.4: Update Alert Component with State-Driven Animations
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours ✅ COMPLETE
**Dependencies**: Task 4.2.2, Task 4.2.3
**Files**: `packages/core/src/navigation-components/primitives/AlertPrimitive.svelte`, `packages/core/src/navigation-components/Alert.svelte`

**Description**:
Refactor Alert component to use Motion One animations driven by state. Alert should have subtle scale+fade animation for non-intrusive presentation.

**What to do**:
- Accept `presentation: PresentationState<any>` prop
- Accept spring configuration override
- Add `$effect` watching `presentation.status`
- Use subtle scale (0.98 → 1) + fade (0 → 1)
- Faster animation than Modal (stiffness: 350, damping: 35)
- Call callbacks on completion
- No backdrop (alert is non-modal)

**Animation Strategy**:
- Very subtle scale: `0.98 → 1` (not 0.95 like Modal)
- Snappier spring for quick feedback
- Fade in/out for smoothness

**Important**: Alert should feel snappy and lightweight, not heavy like Modal. User should immediately see feedback without distraction.

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 5.2

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Alert animates in quickly with subtle scale+fade
- [x] Alert animates out smoothly
- [x] Faster, snappier spring than Modal
- [x] Animations triggered by `$effect` watching state
- [x] Callbacks fire correctly
- [x] Non-intrusive visual presentation
- [x] No backdrop (Alert primitive handles backdrop rendering)

---

## Section 4: Testing & Quality

### Task 4.4.1: Browser Animation Tests (Modal)
**Estimated Time**: 6 hours ✅ DONE
**Dependencies**: Task 4.3.1
**Files**: `packages/core/tests/animations/modal-animation.test.ts`

**Description**:
Write comprehensive browser tests for Modal animation lifecycle using Vitest browser mode. Verify that animations actually run in the browser and state transitions work correctly. **KEY INNOVATION**: Use notification-based testing (Store subscriptions) instead of arbitrary waits.

**What was done**:
- Created `waitForState()` helper that subscribes to Store state changes (NO POLLING!)
- Exposed test store via `window.__modalTestStore` for testing
- Wrote 5 comprehensive tests:
  1. ✅ should animate in when presenting (626ms)
  2. ✅ should animate out when dismissing (1200ms)
  3. ✅ should prevent interactions during animation (649ms)
  4. ✅ should handle rapid open/close transitions (1518ms)
  5. ✅ should animate backdrop independently (598ms)
- Fixed backdrop pointer-events issue during testing
- Tests hook directly into reactive Store subscription system
- **ARCHITECTURE WIN**: Zero arbitrary waits, pure notification-driven testing!

**What to do**:
- Test full lifecycle: idle → presenting → presented → dismissing → idle
- Test state guards prevent invalid transitions:
  - Can't dismiss from `idle`
  - Can't dismiss from `presenting` (optional: can or can't, document decision)
  - Can't present from `dismissing`
  - Can't present from `presenting` (double-tap protection)
- Test `Effect.animated()` dispatches completion actions after duration
- Test `Effect.transition()` generates correct effect pairs
- Test timeout fallback pattern:
  - Batch normal effect (300ms) + timeout effect (600ms)
  - Timeout fires if animation hangs
  - Normal completion prevents timeout from doing anything
- Use Vitest fake timers (`vi.useFakeTimers()`) to control time
- Verify destination remains set during `dismissing` (critical for exit animation)
- Verify both destination and presentation cleared atomically on `idle`

**State Guard Tests**:
```typescript
describe('state guards', () => {
  it('prevents dismissal from presenting state', async () => {
    const store = new TestStore({
      initialState: {
        destination: { type: 'modal', state: {} },
        presentation: { status: 'presenting', content: { type: 'modal', state: {} } }
      },
      reducer
    });

    // Try to dismiss - should be ignored
    await store.send({ type: 'closeButtonTapped' });

    expect(store.state.presentation.status).toBe('presenting'); // Unchanged
  });
});
```

**Timeout Fallback Tests**:
```typescript
describe('timeout fallbacks', () => {
  it('forces completion if animation hangs', async () => {
    vi.useFakeTimers();

    const store = new TestStore({ initialState, reducer });

    await store.send({ type: 'openModal' });
    expect(store.state.presentation.status).toBe('presenting');

    // Normal completion at 300ms
    vi.advanceTimersByTime(300);
    await vi.runAllTimersAsync();

    await store.receive({ type: 'presentation', event: { type: 'presentationCompleted' } });
    expect(store.state.presentation.status).toBe('presented');

    // If animation hung, timeout at 600ms would have forced it
    vi.advanceTimersByTime(600);
    await vi.runAllTimersAsync();
    // No additional effect should fire (normal already completed)
  });
});
```

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 7 (Testing Animations)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Tests cover all four presentation states (idle→presenting→presented→dismissing→idle)
- [x] Tests verify animations actually run in browser
- [x] Tests verify presentation callbacks fire correctly
- [x] Tests use Store subscriptions for notification-based waiting (NO POLLING!)
- [x] Tests verify destination persists during dismissing (modal stays visible)
- [x] Tests verify rapid interactions don't cause stuck states
- [x] Tests verify backdrop animates independently
- [x] All 5 Modal tests pass with 100% success rate
- [ ] State guard tests (TODO - need reducer-level tests)
- [ ] Timeout fallback tests (TODO - need reducer-level tests)

- Wrote comprehensive test suites:
  - Sheet: 6 tests (animate in, animate out, prevent interactions, rapid transitions, backdrop, slide from bottom)
  - Drawer: 6 tests (animate in, animate out, prevent interactions, rapid transitions, backdrop, slide from left)
  - Alert: 5 tests (animate in, animate out, prevent interactions, rapid transitions, backdrop)
- Fixed Drawer wrapper component to pass animation props through to primitive
- All tests use Store subscriptions for deterministic waiting
- All tests pass with 100% success rate

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Sheet: 6/6 tests passing
- ✅ Drawer: 6/6 tests passing
- ✅ Alert: 5/5 tests passing
- ✅ **Total: 17/17 new animation tests passing**
- ✅ **Combined with Modal: 22/22 animation tests passing (100%)**

### Task 4.4.2: Component Animation Tests
**Estimated Time**: 5 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 4.3.1-4.3.4
**Files**:
- `packages/core/tests/navigation-components/Modal.test.ts`
- `packages/core/tests/navigation-components/Sheet.test.ts`
- `packages/core/tests/navigation-components/Drawer.test.ts`
- `packages/core/tests/navigation-components/Alert.test.ts`

**Description**:
Write component-level tests for Modal, Sheet, Drawer, and Alert to verify they correctly integrate with Motion One animations and dispatch presentation events. Mock Motion One to make tests fast and deterministic.

**What to do**:
- Test component renders when `presentation.status !== 'idle'`
- Test component doesn't render when `presentation.status === 'idle'`
- Test `onPresentationComplete` callback fires after animation
- Test `onDismissalComplete` callback fires after animation
- Test spring configuration can be overridden via props
- Test backdrop click dismissal (where applicable)
- Test ESC key dismissal (where applicable)
- Mock Motion One's `animate()` function to avoid actual animations
- Verify `$effect` triggers animations at correct times

**Mocking Pattern**:
```typescript
import { vi } from 'vitest';

// Mock Motion One
vi.mock('motion', () => ({
  animate: vi.fn(() => ({
    finished: Promise.resolve()
  })),
  spring: vi.fn((config) => config)
}));
```

**Important**: Mock Motion One to make tests fast and deterministic. Don't run actual animations in unit tests. Save visual testing for E2E.

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 7.1-7.2

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All 4 components tested for correct render behavior
- [ ] All components tested for event callbacks
- [ ] Tests run quickly (< 50ms each) via mocking
- [ ] Tests are deterministic (no flakiness)
- [ ] Coverage includes error cases (animation failures)
- [ ] Tests verify `$effect` triggers animations
- [ ] 10+ tests per component (40+ total)

### Task 4.4.3: Integration Tests with Product Gallery
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 4.5.1 (Product Gallery migration)
**Files**: `examples/product-gallery/tests/animation-integration.spec.ts`

**Description**:
Write end-to-end tests using Playwright to verify animations work correctly in a real application. Test the Product Gallery's modal presentations and dismissals with actual Motion One animations running.

**What to do**:
- Test product detail modal animates in smoothly (click product)
- Test quick view modal animates in smoothly (click quick view button)
- Test modal dismisses with animation (backdrop click)
- Test modal dismisses with animation (close button)
- Test modal dismisses with animation (ESC key)
- Test rapid interactions don't cause stuck states:
  - Double-click button (should ignore second click)
  - Click dismiss during presenting (should wait or ignore)
  - Open new modal while one is dismissing (should queue or interrupt)
- Verify no visual glitches during animations
- Take screenshots before/during/after animations for regression testing

**Playwright Pattern**:
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('modal animates in smoothly', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173');

  // Click product to open modal
  await page.click('[data-testid="product-1"]');

  // Wait for modal to appear
  await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="product-detail-modal"]', {
    state: 'visible',
    timeout: 1000
  });

  // Verify modal is fully visible (opacity: 1)
  const modal = page.locator('[data-testid="product-detail-modal"]');
  await expect(modal).toBeVisible();

  // Optional: Screenshot for visual regression
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('modal-presented.png');
});

test('rapid clicks dont cause stuck states', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5173');

  // Rapid double-click
  await page.click('[data-testid="product-1"]');
  await page.click('[data-testid="product-1"]');

  // Should only have one modal, not stuck
  await page.waitForTimeout(500);
  const modals = page.locator('[data-testid="product-detail-modal"]');
  await expect(modals).toHaveCount(1);
});
```

**Important**: These are REAL browser tests with REAL animations. They catch visual regressions and timing issues that unit tests miss.

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 7, navigation-spec section 9 (testing patterns)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Tests run in actual browser (Playwright)
- [ ] Tests verify animations complete visually
- [ ] Tests catch stuck states (via timeouts/assertions)
- [ ] Tests verify rapid clicking doesn't break state
- [ ] Screenshots or videos captured for debugging
- [ ] Tests run in CI (headless mode)
- [ ] 10+ E2E tests covering user flows

### Task 4.4.4: Timeout Fallback Helper Implementation
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 4.1.2
**Files**: `packages/core/src/navigation/animation-helpers.ts` (new)

**Description**:
Create reusable timeout fallback patterns to prevent stuck animation states. Provide helper functions that batch normal completion with timeout fallback (2-3x expected duration).

**What to do**:
- Create `withPresentationTimeout()` helper:
  - Accepts duration, createEvent function, timeoutMultiplier (default 2)
  - Returns batched Effect: normal + timeout
  - Ensures state never gets stuck in `presenting`
- Create `withDismissalTimeout()` helper (same pattern for dismissal)
- Create `presentationEffects()` convenience helper for full lifecycle
- Document timeout multiplier recommendations:
  - 2x for fast animations (< 300ms)
  - 3x for slow animations (> 500ms)
  - Higher on mobile (slower devices)
- Add TypeScript types for configuration
- Write usage examples for reducers

**Helper Implementation**:
```typescript
export function withPresentationTimeout<A>(config: {
  duration: number;
  createEvent: (event: { type: 'presentationCompleted' } | { type: 'presentationTimeout' }) => A;
  timeoutMultiplier?: number;
}): Effect<A> {
  const multiplier = config.timeoutMultiplier ?? 2;
  const timeoutDuration = config.duration * multiplier;

  return Effect.batch(
    // Normal completion
    Effect.animated({
      duration: config.duration,
      onComplete: config.createEvent({ type: 'presentationCompleted' })
    }),
    // Timeout fallback
    Effect.animated({
      duration: timeoutDuration,
      onComplete: config.createEvent({ type: 'presentationTimeout' })
    })
  );
}

// Usage in reducer
case 'openModal': {
  return [
    { ...state, presentation: { status: 'presenting', content: modal } },
    withPresentationTimeout({
      duration: 300,
      createEvent: (event) => ({ type: 'presentation', event })
    })
  ];
}

// Handle both events
case 'presentation': {
  if (action.event.type === 'presentationCompleted' ||
      action.event.type === 'presentationTimeout') {
    // Either way, complete the presentation
    if (state.presentation.status !== 'presenting') {
      return [state, Effect.none()];
    }

    if (action.event.type === 'presentationTimeout') {
      console.warn('[Animation] Presentation timeout - forcing completion');
    }

    return [
      { ...state, presentation: { status: 'presented', content: state.presentation.content } },
      Effect.none()
    ];
  }
}
```

**Important**: Timeouts are CRITICAL for production robustness. Animations can fail on:
- Slow devices / CPUs
- Browser tab suspended (battery saver)
- Motion One library bugs
- Network issues (if loading resources)
- User switching tabs mid-animation

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 6.2-6.3, section 3.5-3.6

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `withPresentationTimeout()` creates batched normal + timeout effects
- [ ] `withDismissalTimeout()` creates batched effects for dismissal
- [ ] Default timeout multiplier is 2x (configurable)
- [ ] `presentationEffects()` helper combines both for convenience
- [ ] Clear JSDoc on when/why to use timeouts
- [ ] Examples show reducer integration patterns
- [ ] Tests verify timeout fires if animation never completes
- [ ] Tests verify normal completion prevents timeout from interfering

## Section 5: Example Migration & Documentation

### Task 4.5.1: Migrate Product Gallery to Animated Presentations
**Estimated Time**: 8 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 4.3.1-4.3.4, Task 4.4.4
**Files**: `examples/product-gallery/src/**/*.{ts,svelte}`

**Description**:
Migrate the Product Gallery example application to use the new animation system. Add `presentation: PresentationState<DestinationState>` field to state, handle presentation events in reducer, use timeout fallbacks, and verify animations work end-to-end.

**What to do**:
- Add `presentation` field to `AppState` alongside `destination`
- Update `initialState` to include `presentation: { status: 'idle' }`
- Add `{ type: 'presentation', event: PresentationEvent }` to `AppAction`
- Handle presentation events in `appReducer`:
  - `presentationCompleted`: Transition `presenting` → `presented`
  - `dismissalCompleted`: Transition `dismissing` → `idle`, clear destination
  - `presentationTimeout`: Force completion with warning
  - `dismissalTimeout`: Force cleanup with warning
- Update user actions to set presentation state:
  - `productTapped`: Set both `destination` and `presentation: presenting`
  - `quickViewTapped`: Same pattern
  - `closeButtonTapped`: Transition to `dismissing` (keep destination!)
- Use `withPresentationTimeout()` and `withDismissalTimeout()` helpers
- Add state guards to prevent invalid transitions
- Update components to pass `presentation` prop to Modal/Sheet
- Verify smooth animations for all user flows:
  - Product detail modal
  - Quick view modal
  - Share sheet
  - Add to cart success alert

**Reducer Pattern**:
```typescript
case 'productTapped': {
  const product = action.product;
  const destination = Destination.initial('productDetail', {
    product,
    selectedImage: 0
  });

  // Guard: Only present if idle
  if (state.presentation.status !== 'idle') {
    return [state, Effect.none()];
  }

  return [
    {
      ...state,
      destination,
      presentation: {
        status: 'presenting',
        content: destination,
        duration: 300
      }
    },
    withPresentationTimeout({
      duration: 300,
      createEvent: (event) => ({ type: 'presentation', event })
    })
  ];
}

case 'closeButtonTapped': {
  // Guard: Only dismiss if presented
  if (state.presentation.status !== 'presented') {
    return [state, Effect.none()];
  }

  return [
    {
      ...state,
      // DON'T clear destination yet! Need it for exit animation
      presentation: {
        status: 'dismissing',
        content: state.presentation.content,
        duration: 200
      }
    },
    withDismissalTimeout({
      duration: 200,
      createEvent: (event) => ({ type: 'presentation', event })
    })
  ];
}

case 'presentation': {
  if (action.event.type === 'presentationCompleted' ||
      action.event.type === 'presentationTimeout') {
    // Complete presentation
    if (state.presentation.status !== 'presenting') {
      return [state, Effect.none()];
    }

    if (action.event.type === 'presentationTimeout') {
      console.warn('[Product Gallery] Presentation timeout');
    }

    return [
      { ...state, presentation: { status: 'presented', content: state.presentation.content } },
      Effect.none()
    ];
  }

  if (action.event.type === 'dismissalCompleted' ||
      action.event.type === 'dismissalTimeout') {
    // Complete dismissal - clear BOTH destination and presentation
    if (state.presentation.status !== 'dismissing') {
      return [state, Effect.none()];
    }

    if (action.event.type === 'dismissalTimeout') {
      console.warn('[Product Gallery] Dismissal timeout');
    }

    return [
      {
        ...state,
        destination: null,  // NOW we clear destination
        presentation: { status: 'idle' }
      },
      Effect.none()
    ];
  }

  return [state, Effect.none()];
}
```

**Component Pattern**:
```svelte
<script>
  import { Modal } from '@composable-svelte/core';
  import { scopeTo } from '@composable-svelte/core';
  import ProductDetail from './ProductDetail.svelte';

  const productDetailStore = $derived(
    scopeTo(store).into('destination').case('productDetail')
  );
</script>

<Modal
  presentation={store.state.presentation}
  onPresentationComplete={() => {
    store.dispatch({
      type: 'presentation',
      event: { type: 'presentationCompleted' }
    });
  }}
  onDismissalComplete={() => {
    store.dispatch({
      type: 'presentation',
      event: { type: 'dismissalCompleted' }
    });
  }}
>
  {#if productDetailStore}
    <ProductDetail store={productDetailStore} />
  {/if}
</Modal>
```

**Important**: This serves as the canonical example of animation integration. Code quality matters - this is reference implementation for library users.

**Spec Reference**: animation-integration-spec.md section 2-5 (full lifecycle example)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Product detail modal animates smoothly in/out
- [ ] Quick view modal animates smoothly in/out
- [ ] Share sheet animates smoothly in/out
- [ ] Add to cart alert animates subtly
- [ ] All dismissals animate (backdrop, button, ESC key)
- [ ] No stuck states (guards working)
- [ ] No timeout warnings in console (animations completing)
- [ ] Timeout fallbacks present for production safety
- [ ] Code is clean, well-commented, and exemplary
- [ ] Sequential animations work (dismiss → present)

### Task 4.5.3: Update API Documentation
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Dependencies**: Task 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.2.2
**Files**:
- `docs/api/presentation-state.md` (new)
- `docs/api/effect-animated.md` (new)
- `docs/api/effect-transition.md` (new)
- `docs/api/animation-utilities.md` (new)

**Description**:
Create API reference documentation for all animation-related types, Effect helpers, and utility functions. Provide clear API signatures with all parameters, return types, and examples.

**What to do**:
- Document `PresentationState<T>` type with all four states
- Document `PresentationEvent` type with all event types
- Document `Effect.animated()` signature and parameters
- Document `Effect.transition()` signature and parameters
- Document all animation utility functions (`animateModalIn`, etc.)
- Document `SpringConfig` interface and validation
- Document timeout helpers (`withPresentationTimeout`, etc.)
- Add examples for each API
- Link to animation guide for usage patterns
- Include migration notes (breaking changes from Phase 2/3)

**API Reference Template**:
```markdown
# PresentationState<T>

Type-safe representation of animation lifecycle state.

## Type Definition

\`\`\`typescript
type PresentationState<T> =
  | { readonly status: 'idle' }
  | { readonly status: 'presenting'; readonly content: T; readonly duration?: number }
  | { readonly status: 'presented'; readonly content: T }
  | { readonly status: 'dismissing'; readonly content: T; readonly duration?: number };
\`\`\`

## States

### `idle`
Nothing is being presented. Both `destination` and `presentation` should be null/idle.

### `presenting`
Animation in progress (animating IN). Content is being presented to the user.

**Fields:**
- `content: T` - The content being presented (usually DestinationState)
- `duration?: number` - Optional animation duration hint (ms)

### `presented`
Animation complete, content fully visible. User can interact with content.

**Fields:**
- `content: T` - The content being presented

### `dismissing`
Animation in progress (animating OUT). Content is being dismissed.

**Important:** `destination` field remains set during dismissing (needed for exit animation).

**Fields:**
- `content: T` - The content being dismissed
- `duration?: number` - Optional animation duration hint (ms)

## Usage Example

\`\`\`typescript
interface AppState {
  destination: DestinationState | null;
  presentation: PresentationState<DestinationState>;
}

const initialState: AppState = {
  destination: null,
  presentation: { status: 'idle' }
};
\`\`\`

- **Vitest** (for unit tests with fake timers)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All navigation components use Motion One animations
- [ ] Zero Svelte transitions (consistency enforced)
- [ ] 50+ animation tests passing (unit + integration + E2E)
- [ ] Product Gallery fully animated with smooth transitions
- [ ] No stuck states in any testing (guards + timeouts working)
- [ ] Animation guide published and comprehensive
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] All animations state-driven (not DOM-driven)

---

## Key Principles for Implementation

### 1. State-Driven, Not DOM-Driven
Animations are triggered by `$effect` watching `presentation.status`, NOT by Svelte's mount/unmount lifecycle. This enables:
- Sequential coordination (dismiss A → present B)
- Parallel coordination (fade modal + backdrop)
- Conditional coordination (present B only if A dismissed)
- Deterministic testing (control state, control animations)

### 2. Animations Are State
Track lifecycle in reducers via `PresentationState<T>`. This makes animations:
- Testable (dispatch actions, assert state)
- Debuggable (inspect state in DevTools)
- Time-travel capable (record/replay actions)
- Deterministic (same actions = same animations)

### 3. State Guards Everywhere
Always validate current state before transitioning:
```typescript
if (state.presentation.status !== 'presented') {
  return [state, Effect.none()]; // Ignore invalid action
}
```

### 4. Timeout Fallbacks for Production
Use `withPresentationTimeout()` and `withDismissalTimeout()` to prevent stuck states:
- Animations can fail (slow devices, bugs, browser issues)
- Timeouts ensure state always progresses (2-3x duration)
- Log warnings but complete successfully

### 5. Spring Physics by Default
Use Motion One's spring easing for natural feel:
- Modal: Snappy (300/30)
- Sheet: Softer (250/28)
- Drawer: Smooth (280/25)
- Alert: Very snappy (350/35)

### 6. Error Handling
Animation functions catch errors and always resolve:
```typescript
try {
  await animate(...).finished;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('[animate] Failed:', error);
  // Still resolve - don't break state machine
}
```

### 7. Keep Content Mounted During Dismissing
Element must stay in DOM during exit animation:
```svelte
{#if presentation.status !== 'idle'}
  <div>Content stays mounted through 'dismissing'</div>
{/if}
```

### 8. Dual-Field Pattern
Separate `destination` (what) from `presentation` (how):
- `destination`: Logical data (remains set during dismissing)
- `presentation`: Animation lifecycle (controls transitions)
- Both cleared atomically when `idle`
