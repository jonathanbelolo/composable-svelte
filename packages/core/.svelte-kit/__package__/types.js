 * Core type definitions for Composable Svelte.

 * This module defines the foundational types for the architecture:
 * - Reducers: Pure functions that transform state based on actions
 * - Effects: Declarative descriptions of side effects
 * - Store: The runtime that manages state and executes effects
 * - Dependencies: External services injected into reducers
