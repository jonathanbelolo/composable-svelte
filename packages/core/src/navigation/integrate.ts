/**

 * - 87% less integration boilerplate
 * - Chainable API for multiple children
 * - Type-safe field access
 * - Automatic PresentationAction handling

/**
 * Create a fluent builder for integrating child reducers.
 *
 * This function starts a builder chain that composes child reducers into a
 * parent reducer using the ifLetPresentation pattern. Each `.with()` call
 * adds another child integration, and `.build()` produces the final reducer.
 *
 * **What it does:**
 * - Wraps core reducer logic
 * - Provides fluent `.with(field, childReducer)` API
 * - Automatically handles PresentationAction unwrapping
 * - Batches effects from core + all child reducers
 * - Type-safe field access via keyof
 *
 * **Performance:**
 * - Zero overhead at runtime (compiles to manual ifLet calls)
 * - No additional function calls vs manual integration
 * - Tree-shakeable if unused
 *
 * @template State - Parent state type
 * @template Action - Parent action type
 * @param coreReducer - The core parent reducer (without child integration)
 * @returns IntegrationBuilder for chaining `.with()` calls
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Manual pattern (before):
 * const reducer: Reducer<State, Action> = (state, action, deps) => {
 *   // Core logic
 *   const [s1, e1] = coreReducer(state, action, deps);
 *
 *   // Child integration (verbose!)
 *   const [s2, e2] = ifLetPresentation(
 *     (s) => s.destination,
 *     (s, d) => ({ ...s, destination: d }),
 *     'destination',
 *     (ca) => ({ type: 'destination', action: ca }),
 *     destinationReducer
 *   )(s1, action, deps);
 *
 *   return [s2, Effect.batch(e1, e2)];
 * };
 *
 * // DSL pattern (after):
 * const reducer = integrate(coreReducer)
 *   .with('destination', destinationReducer)
 *   .build();
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Multiple child integrations:
 * const reducer = integrate(coreReducer)
 *   .with('destination', destinationReducer)
 *   .with('alert', alertReducer)
 *   .with('sheet', sheetReducer)
 *   .build();
 * ```

	 * Integrate a child reducer at a specific state field.
	 *
	 * This method adds a child reducer integration for an optional field in the parent state.
	 * The field must be nullable (to support dismissal), and the parent action type must
	 * have a corresponding case with a PresentationAction wrapper.
	 *
	 * **Assumptions:**
	 * - Parent state has field `K` with type `ChildState | null`
	 * - Parent action has case `{ type: K; action: PresentationAction<ChildAction> }`
	 * - Child reducer operates on non-null `ChildState`
	 *
	 * **What it handles:**
	 * - PresentationAction unwrapping (dismiss + presented)
	 * - State extraction and update
	 * - Effect mapping from child to parent
	 * - Effect batching with core reducer
	 *
	 * @template K - The state field key (must be keyof State)

	 * @param field - The state field name (e.g., 'destination', 'alert')
	 * @param childReducer - The child reducer to integrate
	 * @returns this (for method chaining)
