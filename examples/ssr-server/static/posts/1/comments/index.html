This ensures smooth hydration and predictable behavior.</p>\n\n      <p><strong>Effect Handling:</strong> Design effects to be resumable. When the page hydrates, effects should pick up where the server left off.</p>\n\n      <p><strong>Performance:</strong> Use SSR for the initial render, then let the client take over for subsequent interactions. This gives you the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n      <p>Remember: the architecture is designed to scale. Start simple, and add complexity only when needed.</p>\n    "},{"id":4,"title":"Testing Strategies for SSR","author":"Mike Tester","date":"2025-01-12","tags":["testing","ssr","quality"],"content":"\n      <p>Testing server-rendered applications requires a different approach than client-only apps. Here's what you need to know:</p>\n\n      <p><strong>Unit Tests:</strong> Test your reducers in isolation. They're pure functions, so this is straightforward and fast.</p>\n\n      <p><strong>Integration Tests:</strong> Verify that state serialization and hydration work correctly. TestStore is your friend here.</p>\n\n      <p><strong>E2E Tests:</strong> Test the full flow - server render, client hydration, and user interactions. This catches issues that unit tests might miss.</p>\n\n      <p>The key is to test at multiple levels. Pure functions make testing easy, and the architecture makes it natural.</p>\n    "},{"id":5,"title":"Fastify and Modern Node.js","author":"Alex Performance","date":"2025-01-15","tags":["fastify","nodejs","performance"],"content":"\n      <p><strong>Fastify</strong> is one of the fastest web frameworks for Node.js, and it's perfect for SSR applications. Here's why:</p>\n\n      <p><em>Speed:</em> Fastify is designed for performance from the ground up. It's significantly faster than Express while being just as easy to use.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Schema Validation:</em> Built-in JSON schema validation ensures your data is correct before it reaches your application logic.</p>\n\n      <p><em>Plugin System:</em> Fastify's encapsulated plugin system makes it easy to organize your code and share functionality.</p>\n\n      <p>Combined with Composable Svelte's efficient rendering, you get an incredibly fast stack for building modern web applications.</p>\n    "}],"comments":[{"id":1,"postId":1,"author":"Alice Reader","date":"2025-01-06","content":"Great introduction!
